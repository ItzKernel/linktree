# Linktree

This is my personal linktree, nothing special.  

## Building the site
The only thing you have to build for now are the scss files.  
To do that, you'll need [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install) installed.  

### How to do it
1. Go into the style directory
2. Run `sh watch.sh` (otherwise you can run the content of the file in your terminal of course)
3. If the css file is there, you can delete the map file and stop the process
